## Rebuttal to Yatil's [_"WCAG 3 is not ready yet"_][1]

Early December of 2021, [Eric Eggert (Yatil)'s opinion piece][1] has been re-used and re-posted over the last few years by others of a small group of individuals that have been actively obstructing the improvement of readability and visual accessibility standards. We refer to them collectively as _"the obstructionists"_.

The piece itself is of little value, but it has come to our attention that it is being used as a reference, cited to obstruct the progress of actual accessibility research by creating an atmosphere of confusion and animosity. As such, it needs to be challenged. It does not contain facts, but rather is a string of provocative logical fallacies, which we [dissect on a line by line basis.l][1]

## Derailed analysis of APCA 
User xi (Tobias Bengfort) created an unauthorized repo called "apca-introduction" which is, unfortunately, misleading. We forked the repo to clarify, make corrections, and set the record straight. 

### Corrections to xi's [Dissing Introduction to APCA][2]
The corrected ["The missing introduction to APCA"][2] linked here, was revised for accuracy only, with the intention of maintaining xi's original tone and simplicity. THe corrections were necessarry, as the original is significantly biased. For instance, the visual examples are set with low spatial frequency fonts that are well into contrast constancy, so as to hide the true and important differences. In addition, the original applied unauthorized modifications to the code, invalidating any results.

### Rebuttal to xi's [Derailed APCA Analysis][3]
We find user xi's ["Detailed analysis of APCA"][3] flawed and misleading for a number of reasons. He misappropriates the math and eliminates key properties of the APCA method. As a result his "analysis" is invalid. 

### Math, Lies, and Videotape
[In his blog, xi attempts to examine contrast maths][4]. xi states he has a math degree, and while he admits to being a lay person in the field of vision and color, he asserts inappropriate math to "prove" his theories. But that's not how math and vision science work together, and his claims are neither supportable nor salient. 

- Why spend energy to discuss? Because xi has indicated apparent ties to the obstructionist group.
    - If in fact xi is following their lead, then everything he states on the subject is motivated not by science but as part of a more significant effort toward preventing the improvement of accessibility.
        - This would explain the apparent cognitive dissonance with the faux analysis and corruptions of math and methods, which appears intended to confuse and not illustrate.

## SIDEBAR: Organizational Politics
We have been made aware of a small group of individuals obstructing the work toward actual accessibility as it pertains to visual readability. Their underlying motivations may seem unclear, though recent insights have implied motivations that are far from altruistic. The visible-yet-vacuous toxic personalities opposing the subject matter are posturing to feed off a narcissistic supply, at the expense of the community. And the cognitive dissonance they have caused through their manipulation, has created a divisive bitterness in the a11y community.

Some of this has impacted the internal politics of the W3C's AGWG, inflaming an untenable and ongoing problem. Our proactive response, to maintain momentum and continue the work and development, has been founding the non-profit Inclusive Reading Technologies, Inc. The [APC-Readability Criterion](https://readtech.org/ARC/) is a public working draft, and provides solid and useful guidance for designers to ensure visual accessibility and improved readability for all users. APC-RC guidelines are derived from the decades of peer-reviewed readability research, as detailed in the several bibliographies contained within.

**Legislatures should be aware that portions of WCAG&nbsp;2 are not fit for use in law or regulation**; if it were a voluntary guideline, the potential for harm would not be such a concern, but when elevated to statute law, the potential for harm is unacceptable. The unfortunate part here is that the serious problems of WCAG&nbsp;2's contrast SCs cast a dark shadow on some important aspects of WCAG&nbsp;2.

### Don't be led astray, WCAG&nbsp;2.x SCs 1.4.3 & 1.4.11 are not fit for purpose.
These two SCs affect the vast majority of visual web content, yet neither is supported by science, nor peer review, nor testing. WCAG 2's contrast math/methods do not support actual accessibility, and in fact can result in conditions that are worse for those with color vision deficiencies. The understanding docs of WCAG 2.x contain false or misleading information, and the premise lacks scientific support. 1.4.3 and 1.4.11 should not be incorporated into any laws nor regulations. This could be said of a few other SCs, but these two in particular have resulted in the greatest misunderstandings, and the greatest harm to users and readability.

A critical view of the actions here and elsewhere, clearly reveal a motivation to obstruct, with a darker purpose. This can not be allowed to stand. Fixing the significant problems of web content readability is one we take seriously, as is evidenced by our continued development of free-to-use guidelines and technologies.

Considering that the emergence of the World Wide Web as a content distribution system effectively replaced traditional print, the obligation for supporting effective readability of digital content should not be underestimated. Inadaquate or improper standards for visually readable content results in high visual fatigue, inaccessible content, and ultimately reduced reading for a majority of the population. By some measures, reading has decreased by as much as 40% over the last two decades. A seven word meme does not convey understanding the way a seven hundred or seven thousand word article can. Projecting forward, the societal consequence is dystopian at best. A public that does not read is a public shrouded in ignorance, leading to a public ripe for manipulationâ€”as history has shown us all too often.

Consider this when you ask why certain individuals are opposed to improving visual accessibility and readability of digital content. 

Thank you for reading.
