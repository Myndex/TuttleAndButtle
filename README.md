## Rebuttal to Yatil's [_"WCAG 3 is not ready yet"_][1]

Early December of 2021, [Eric Eggert (Yatil)'s opinion piece][1] has been re-used and re-posted over the last few years by others of a small group of individuals that have been actively obstructing the improvement of readability and visual accessibility standards. We refer to them collectively as _"the obstructionists"_.

The piece itself is of little value, but it has come to our attention that it is being used as a reference, cited to obstruct the progress of actual accessibility research by creating an atmosphere of confusion and animosity. As such, it needs to be challenged. It does not contain facts, but rather is a string of provocative logical fallacies, as discussed below, on a line by line basis.

## Derailed analysis of APCA 
User xi (Tobias Bengfort) created an unauthorized repo called "apca-introduction" which unfortunately is misleading. This fork is intended to clarify, make corrections, and set the record straight. 

### Corrections to xi's [Dissing Introduction to APCA][2]
The corrected ["The missing introduction to APCA"][2] at the link was revised for accuracy only, with the intention of maintaining xi's original tone and simplicity. The original is significantly biased in that the examples are set well into contrast constancy, to hide the true differences. Here in the corrected version, we are actually using APCA, while xi is using a corrupt and unauthorized modification which is not APCA, yet he is calling it that to cause confusion on the issue... 

### Rebuttal to xi's [Derailed APCA Analysis][3]
We find user xi's ["Detailed analysis of APCA"][3] flawed and misleading for a number of reasons. He abstracts the math and/or creates his own version of the math and eliminates many of the key properties of the APCA method in performing his "analysis." But then he goes further to create his own separate contrast math and claims it is a "version" of WCAG_2, which it clearly is not. What it is, is a crude and incomplete attempt to reverse engineer the APCA contrast curves...

### Math, Lies, and Videotape
[In his blog, xi attempts to examine contrast maths][4]. xi states he has a math degree, but he presents as a lay person in the field of vision and color. He then proceeds to use math to "prove" his therories, but that's not how math and vision science work together. In good faith, xi has been provided a list of book on the subject of color appearance models and vision, but it would appear he has not taken the time nor effort to educate himself, and instead continues to display an unfortunate ignorance of the subject. 

- Why spend energy to discuss? Because xi has indicated apparent ties to the obstructionist group.
    - If in fact xi is following their lead, then everything he states on the subject is motivated not by science but as part of a more significant effort toward preventing the improvement of accessibility.
        - This would explain the apparent cognitive dissonance with his faux analysis and his corruptions of the maths.

## SIDEBAR: Organizational Politics
There is a small group of people obstructing the work toward actual accessibility as it pertains to visual readability. Their underlying motivations may seem unclear, though recent insights have demonstrated motivations that are far from altruistic. The visible-yet-vacuous toxic personalities opposing the subject matter are simply posturing to feed off a narcissistic supply at the expense of the community. And the cognitive dissonance they have caused through manipulation, has created a divisive bitterness in the a11y community.

Some of this has impacted the internal politics of the W3C's AGWG, inflaming an untenable and ongoing problem. Our proactive response, to maintain momentum and continue the work and development, has been founding the non-profit Inclusive Reading Technologies, Inc. The [APC-Readability Criterion](https://readtech.org/ARC/) is a public working draft, and provides solid and useful guidance for designers to ensure visual accessibility and improved readability for all users.

**Legislatures should be aware that portions of WCAG&nbsp;2 are not fit for use in law or regulation**; if it were a voluntary guideline, the potential for harm would not be such a concern, but when elevated to statute law, the potential for harm is unacceptable. The unfortunate part here is that the serious problems of WCAG&nbsp;2's contrast SCs cast a dark shadow on some important aspects of WCAG&nbsp;2.

### Don't be led astray, WCAG&nbsp;2.x SCs 1.4.3 & 1.4.11 are not fit for purpose.
These two SCs affect the vast majority of visual web content, yet neither is supported by science, nor peer review, nor testing. WCAG 2's contrast math/methods do not support actual accessibility, and in fact can result in conditions that are worse for those with color vision deficiencies. The understanding docs of WCAG 2.x contain false or misleading information, and the premise lacks scientific support. 1.4.3 and 1.4.11 should not be incorporated into any laws nor regulations. Thic could be said of a few other SCs, but these two in particular have resulted in the greatest misunderstandings, and the greatest harm to users.

A critical view of the actions here and elsewhere, clearly reveal a motivation to obstruct, with a darker purpose. This can not be allowed to stand. Fixing the significant problems of web content readability is one we take seriously, as is evidenced by our continued development of free-to-use guidelines and technologies.

Thank you for reading.
